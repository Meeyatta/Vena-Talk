# Vena-Talk

Vena-Talk is an app for deadlock what automatically types in a Bible verse each time you kill an enemy as Venator.
That's it.

# Usage

Launch it in the background while playing as Venator. Each time you get a kill, your character will briefly stop, type in a random verse in all-chat and then go back to normal. 
Make sure you don't play in windowned mode and have all-chat binded to "shift+enter" for the app to work.
